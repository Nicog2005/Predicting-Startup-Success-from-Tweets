# Predicting Startup Success from Tweets

In this project I am testing different models to predict startup success based on the companies Twitter account. I am then assuming some investment costs and profits if the startup is actually successful. After executin the model I "invest" in the top 5 companies with higher succes rate and calculate the theoretical ROI.
